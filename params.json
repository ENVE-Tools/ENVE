The ENVE methodology, in general, consists of two major modules, which include capturing and modeling the inherent noise (sample- and technical-associated variability) in whole-exome sequencing data using non-tumor diploid normal samples, followed by utilizing the learned model parameters to reliably detect somatic copy-number alterations in tumors.\r\n\r\n###The key features of ENVE include\r\n\r\n* Empirical quantification inherent noise in WES data using random normal-normal combinations of diploid samples.\r\n* Use of three independent measures to differentiate between segmental LogRatio variations associated with inherent noise versus germline CNVs within these normal-normal comparisons.\r\n* Modeling extreme deviations of chromosome-specific LogRatios associated with inherent noise within the diploid normal-normal comparisons by using a generalized extreme value distribution.\r\n* By use of these learned model parameters, to evaluate somatic copy-number alterations in tumor samples.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe algorithm behind ENVE is developed by Dr. Vinay Varadan at Case Western Reserve University. Salendra Singh(@sxs1528) had developed and maintain and updates the module.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFeel free to contact Salendra Singh(@sxs1528) by sending me a mail at sxs1528@case.edu. I will try to sort out the problems as soon as possible. \r\n","google":"UA-57342448-1","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
