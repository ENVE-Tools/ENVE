{"name":"ENVE (Version:0.9.0)","tagline":"Extreme Value Distribution Based Somatic Copy-Number Variation Estimation ","body":"### **Introduction**\r\n___________________________________________________________________________________\r\n##### **ENVE** is a novel and robust methodology for detecting somatic copy-number alterations in massively parallel DNA sequencing data derived from stromal-admixed clinical samples.   ENVE models inherent noise in whole-exome sequencing data using non-malignant tissue samples, and utilizes the learned model for robust estimation of sCNAs in tumors. \r\n\r\n____________________________________________________________________________________\r\n### **The salient features and merits of ENVE methodology are that it:**\r\n____________________________________________________________________________________\r\n#####* Accounts for and models both technical- and sample-associated variability in whole-exome sequencing data using non-tumor diploid normal samples\r\n#####* Reliably detects copy-number alterations among clinical samples with varying stromal admixture without the need for estimating tumor ploidy or content\r\n#####* Performs robust somatic copy-number estimation using either matched or unmatched tumor-normal samples in an unbiased manner\r\n#####* By use of these learned model parameters, to evaluate somatic copy-number alterations in tumor samples.\r\n#####* Requires no a priori parameters or user-intervention.\r\n#####* Is applicable across deep sequencing platforms and tissue types.\r\n#####* Is implemented to be easily portable, requiring lightweight computational resources.\r\n\r\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\r\n### Support or Contact\r\n##### __Contact : Salendra Singh__     __Email : sxs1528@case.edu__","google":"UA-57342448-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
